# Project-3: E-Commerce Inventory & Order Insights (SQL)

## Project Description
This project is based on analyzing e-commerce sales and order data using SQL.  
The main objective of this project is to practice SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, and window functions by working on a real-world dataset.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Database: SQL Server
- Language: SQL (T-SQL)
- Tool: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Dataset: E-commerce dataset from Kaggle

- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- OrderDetails
- Region
- Warehouse
- Employee

## Project Workflow
1. Imported CSV files into raw staging tables.
2. Checked and analyzed the data to understand formats and values.
3. Created final tables with proper data types.
4. Inserted cleaned data from raw tables into final tables.
5. Applied primary key and foreign key constraints.
6. Performed analysis using SQL queries.

## Analysis Performed
- Best-selling products based on quantity sold
- Revenue generated by each product
- Revenue contribution by product category
- Daily order trend analysis
- Identification of repeat customers
- Ranking products using window functions
- Finding the latest order for each customer

---

## SQL Concepts Used
- JOIN operations
- GROUP BY and aggregate functions
- Primary Key and Foreign Key
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- Data type conversion and cleaning

---

## Key Findings
- Storage category is the highest revenue-generating category.
- High-priced products contribute more revenue even with fewer sales.
- No repeat customers were found in the dataset.
- Order volume varies across different dates.
