# E-Commerce Inventory & Order Insights

## Key Insights from Analysis

1. The most sold products are mainly computer hardware items such as graphics cards and processors, which shows high demand for performance-based products.

2. Some products generate high revenue even with fewer sales because of their higher prices. For example, premium RAM products contribute significantly to total revenue.

3. Among all categories, the Storage category generates the highest revenue, followed by Video Cards and Mother Boards.

4. Daily order analysis shows that the number of orders changes from day to day, which means customer demand is not consistent.

5. No repeat customers were found in the dataset. This indicates that each customer has placed only one order, or the dataset contains limited historical data.

6. Window functions like RANK() and ROW_NUMBER() were used to rank products by revenue and to find the latest order for each customer.
